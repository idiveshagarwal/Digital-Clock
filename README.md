# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was initialized with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

To get started, navigate to the project directory and run the following commands:

### `npm start`

This command runs the application in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

The page will automatically reload if you make any edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Use this command to launch the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more information on running tests, refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section.

### `npm run build`

Running this command builds the application for production and creates a `build` folder.\
React is bundled in production mode and the build is optimized for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include unique hashes.\
Your application is now ready for deployment!

For more information on deployment, refer to the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This operation is irreversible. Once you `eject`, you cannot go back!**

If you are unsatisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.\
This command removes the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it copies all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control over them.\
All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will refer to the copied scripts, allowing you to customize them as needed.\
Keep in mind that once you eject, you are on your own.

Remember, you do not have to use `eject`. The default feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments, and you can always customize it later.
